## Tell us a bit about yourself.

I’m Shylaja Mohandass, a researcher in the Biocompute Lab at the University of Bristol, working with Thomas Gorochowski. My focus is on reprogramming cyanobacteria for diverse applications. Currently, I’m developing a versatile toolkit of functional biological parts, designed to be modularly assembled into genetic circuits for precise gene regulation in cyanobacteria.

## How did you end up working on the CYBER project?

My journey with cyanobacteria began during my master’s, where I was first introduced to these fascinating organisms. The more I learned, the deeper my curiosity grew, ultimately leading me to pursue a Ph.D. focused on genetically modifying cyanobacteria to tackle environmental challenges.

Eager to bridge the gap between research and real-world applications, I spent time in industry to understand how scientific discoveries translate into products. Later, during my first postdoc at Queen Mary, London, I explored the dynamic aspects of cyanobacterial motility and predation in real time.

Driven by a passion for continuous learning and innovation, I was looking for opportunities to expand my expertise and exploit cyanobacteria for real-world applications. When I came across the CYBER project leveraging cutting-edge synthetic biology to reprogram cyanobacteria for diverse applications, I knew it was the perfect fit. Now, I’m here, working in CYBER project, chasing my dreams, and contributing to the exciting field of cyanobacterial research.

## What are you most excited about in your role?

I have been passionate about synthetic biology since its rapid rise, and I am thrilled to be part of a project that pushes its boundaries. I am especially excited about learning new techniques and collaborating with experts from diverse fields like ecology, deep learning, cybersecurity and protein science. The CYBER project’s close ties with industry also provide me an ample opportunity to see firsthand how research transforms into real-world.

## What do you think is going to be the toughest challenge for CYBER?

Cyanobacteria are eco-friendly organisms, yet their immense genomic and morphological diversity makes genetic modification a toughest challenge. With thousands of strains identified many still unexplored and unlocking their full potential remains a mystery.

The core aim of this project is to develop a versatile toolkit that functions across a broad range of cyanobacterial strains. Due to the vast genomic diversity of cyanobacteria, developing a broadly applicable toolkit is a significant challenge. While synthetic biology techniques have been extensively optimized for model organisms such as E. coli, Bacillus, and yeast, their application in cyanobacteria is less explored. Adapting and optimizing these methods for cyanobacterial systems presents a complex task but also offers substantial opportunities for innovation and discovery.

## Where do you see yourself headed in the future?

I am eager to explore new opportunities in making cyanobacteria more accessible and easier to engineer. My goal is to contribute to future research projects that bridge the gap between academic research and real-world applications. Just like genetic circuits rely on regulatory elements, my journey is shaped by key influences that guide my path. But one thing is certain, I will continue pushing the boundaries of research to find innovative solutions to pressing challenges.
