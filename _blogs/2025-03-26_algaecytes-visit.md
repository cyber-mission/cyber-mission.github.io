## Shylaja visiting AlgaeCytes

Shylaja's application for an AlgaeCytes visit on the 28th March 2026 was successful! This includes a travel award of up to £200. We asked her precisly what this means for herself and the CYBER project more broadly:

> I am thrilled to have been selected for a one-day networking visit to Algaecytes, an opportunity made possible by Algae-UK and organized by Phycoclub. Located at Discovery Park, Sandwich, Kent, UK, Algaecytes cultivates algae at a pilot scale, producing high-value commercial products such as Omega-3 and natural plant bio-stimulants.

> During my visit, I will explore upstream algal cultivation and scale-up, gain insights into commercial pilot plant operations, downstream processing, and analytics. This visit presents an incredible chance to engage with leading scientists and industry experts across the UK, facilitating knowledge exchange, fostering collaborations, and understanding how Algaecytes translates cutting-edge research into real-world applications.

> Being selected for this visit is a valuable opportunity to showcase our CYBER project, expanding its reach while unlocking new opportunities for collaboration and novel research ideas
