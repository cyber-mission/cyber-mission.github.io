    "description": "Microscopic organisms play a key role in the function of diverse ecologies spanning agricultural soils to your own gut. However, characterising the precise species present is hugely challenging. In this work, we demonstrate how elements of a bacterial immune system called CRISPR/Cas9 can be repurposed to enable targeted sequencing of environmental DNA samples to accurate classify the species present. Our methodology support more efficient, quantitative and complete monitoring of community composition and provides biologists with a tool to better understand the true diversity of life in complex environments.
