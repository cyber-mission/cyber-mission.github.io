Standards and metrology will form a core theme across all projects and be supported by the National Measurements Lab (NML). NMLâ€™s role in CYBER will be to provide advice and guidance on the use of biometrology and standards across the entire project, as well as more specific development and validation of digital PCR (dPCR) methods for accurate species abundance and spatial distribution measurements in the EWTs.  This will support traceability of engineered cells in natural environments and facilitate safe deployment.
