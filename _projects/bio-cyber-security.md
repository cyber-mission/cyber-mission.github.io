Building trust in the provenance of the cells we engineer and the ability to track engineered organisms in complex ecosystems will be crucial for broader acceptance of engineering biology for environmental contexts. To this aim, we will seek to enhance the security and trustworthiness of engineered cells, particularly focusing on cyanobacteria used in environmental restoration projects. The primary goal is to develop molecular biology and digital tools for tracking these engineered organisms in complex ecosystems, ensuring their integrity, provenance and monitoring their distribution in model environments.
