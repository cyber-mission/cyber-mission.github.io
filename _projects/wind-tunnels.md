Key to safeguarding and testing genetic modifications for use in the real world is to investigate how the stochasticity and complexity of natural systems can impact the longevity of engineered organisms. This work package will manipulate the biotic and abiotic complexity of experimental ecosystems to track the drop off in modifications through time and in response to stressful conditions.
