My research journey spans the fields of bioinformatics, biosecurity, and synthetic biology, with a focus on computational methods for genomic analysis of microbes and microbial engineering. I have professional experience in Bioinformatics and have worked extensively on projects in computer-aided drug design, molecular docking, and microbial genomics and metabolic modeling. Currently, as part of the CYBER team at Newcastle University, I am excited to contribute to the mission of environmental restoration through the development of safe, traceable genomic barcoding systems for cyanobacteria. This role allows me to apply my expertise in bioinformatics and synthetic biology to engineer biosecurity measures that align with our projectâ€™s sustainability and safety goals.
