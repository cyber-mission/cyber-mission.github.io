My research focuses on the development of machine learning methods for diverse biological datasets, with applications ranging from drug-target interaction prediction to enzyme function classification. During my PhD at Middle East Technical University, I worked on innovative deep learning approaches such as transfer learning and self-supervised learning to improve predictive models in bioinformatics, even when data is limited. My work spans various tasks, including predicting enzyme commission numbers, exploring molecular interactions and predicting molecular properties. As part of the CYBER team at the University of Edinburgh, I will develop learning algorithms for the design of DNA parts using large genotype-phenotype data.
