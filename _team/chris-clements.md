Chris Clements is a Senior Lecturer based in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Bristol, UK. His labâ€™s interests are in the predictability of biological dynamics, in both real world and experimental systems, with a particular focus on resilience loss and the implications of stability change for conservation. He has a long history using experimental systems as tools to understand the dynamics of real-world populations, communities, and ecosystems, and will be using this knowledge to develop the ecological wind tunnels on the CYBER project.

He did his PhD at the University of Sheffield, before carrying out a 3 year post doc at the University of Zurich, was then a SNSF advanced fellow at the University of Melbourne, and has subsequently been employed at the University of Bristol as a Lecturer since 2018.

He currently holds two NERC grants as PI (Timeline to collapse, and Multistress), one as Co-I (The coherence of ecological stability among ecosystems and across ecological scales), and one ARC discovery grant as Co-I (Microcosm experiments for improved species distribution models).
