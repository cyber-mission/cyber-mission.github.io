I am an experimental microbiologist, and my past research has focused on the use of laboratory models to directly study the ecology and evolution of complex microbial communities. I have previously studied at the University of Exeter for my Masters, building a model community of soil bacteria to study ecological interactions, and at University College Cork for my PhD alongside APC Microbiome Ireland to study the effects of antibiotic exposure on the human gut microbiome. With the CYBER project, I will be working with Chris Clements at the University of Bristol to build 'ecological wind tunnels', which will test the function of genetically modified bacteria in simulations of natural environments.
