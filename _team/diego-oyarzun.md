Diego is originally from Valdivia in southern Chile. Originally trained in Electrical Engineering, he currently leads the [Biomolecular Control Group](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/doyarzun/) at the University of Edinburgh, developing new technologies at the interface of biology, mathematics and artificial intelligence, with applications in biotechnology and future therapies. Large parts of his work are in collaboration with experimental laboratories in the UK, Europe and the USA.

Prior to Edinburgh, Diego was a Marie Curie Fellow at INRIA Sophia Antipolis (France, 2010), and Research Fellow in Biomathematics at Imperial College London (2013-2019). Since 2019 he holds a joint appointment between the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) and the [School of Biological Sciences](https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology) at the University of Edinburgh. Diego is Director of the [UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Biomedical AI](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/biomedical-ai), Director of the [MRC Cross-Disciplinary Fellowships](https://www.ed.ac.uk/cross-disciplinary-fellowships) at Edinburgh, and co-founder of the [Edinburgh Science for Sustainability Hub](https://www.ed.ac.uk/science-for-sustainability.

He was awarded a Global Future Council Fellowship by the World Economic Forum (2016), a Young Global Changer award by the G20 presidency (2017), and a fellowship from the Alan Turing Institute (2021). He provides expert advice to a number of bodies in the UK and globally (WEF, OECD, DSIT) on Engineering Biology and biotechnology applications.

As part of CYBER, Diego’s team leads the AI and machine learning work to predict the impact of genetic modification on cell function. These models will help us accelerate the design cycle through a combination of experimentation, model training and model querying.
