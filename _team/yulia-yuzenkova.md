Yulia, a Senior Lecturer at Newcastle University, has established her lab as a holder of a Royal Society University Research Fellowship. Prior to relocating to Britain, she did her PhD at the Academy of Science in Russia, followed by postdoctoral research at Rutgers University in the USA.

Yulia's research focuses on gene expression in different bacteria, investigating how it is affected by antibiotics and exploited by bacteriophages. Recently, she conducted pioneering research on the molecular mechanisms, structure and dynamics of transcription machinery of cyanobacteria. Currently, her work expanded into the regulation of gene expression by the circadian clock in cyanobacteria and its coordination with other cellular processes.
