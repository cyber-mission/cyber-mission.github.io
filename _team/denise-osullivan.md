I have 16 years experience as a molecular microbiologist with a focus on the medical microbiology field. Currently work at the National Measurement Laboratory as a Principal Scientist where I have spent over ten years leading research focused on improving the accuracy of molecular methods ranging from applied diagnostic to metagenomic research. I maintain a wide ranging international network of key academic, clinical, and industrial collaborations interested in both research and development as well as applied testing.
