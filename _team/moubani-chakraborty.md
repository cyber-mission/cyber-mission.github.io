During my PhD I have studied cyclic nucleotide-binding proteins in mycobacteria and developed a strong passion for understanding the function of a variety of proteins. My training in Microbiology and Biochemistry and my desire to benefit the environment via scientific research, are the roots for my interest in this interesting mission to reprogram cyanobacteria. As a part of this team, my focus would be on unravelling the mechanisms behind the functioning of cyanobacterial RNA polymerase and analysing in vitro gene expression. I will be genetically manipulating cyanobacteria to better suit them to perform bioremediation and fine-tuning their properties to generate their most robust versions, serving the aim of this project.
